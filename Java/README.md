# Hangman In Java

## Available Frameworks and Libraries

- JavaFX

## Prerequisition

If you want to be able to run the codes that are written in any of these frameworks, you must have _Java_ (version 15) and _JavaFX_ (version 15) installed. I also recomment _IntelliJ IDEA_ for IDE of choice.

- Install _Java_ from [here](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk15-downloads.html).
- Install _JavaFX_ from [here](https://gluonhq.com/products/javafx/)
- Install _IntelliJ IDEA_ from [here](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/#section=linux)
